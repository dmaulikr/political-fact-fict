# Political Fact or Fiction

### TODOs (next things to implement)
* Question time limit decreases as score increases (done)
* Make source links clickable (done)
* Transition to help screen first time player taps single and multiplayer (tried, but too complicated for something i'm not sure about)
* Make new icon for help button so it matches new font (done)
* Make sure app meets app store guidelines

### Bugs
* Game crashes on occasion (when statement 1 appears?) (i think i fixed)
* Horizontal view distorted for most views (fixed for most pages, but not all)
* Gameover screen list of statements sometimes is squished if answer is too long
